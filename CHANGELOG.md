## 2.0.0 (2021-06-08)

This is a breaking change! As of v1.1.8+, `aredis` has been hard-forked and
renamed to `yaaredis`. The `aredis` changelog is maintained below (see
`1.1.8`_ for posterity).

#### Breaking Changes

* rename package to `yaaredis` ([1ea13dd](1ea13dd))
* remove all deprecated features ([f4699a45](f4699a45)):
  * deprecated methods have been removed
  * deprecated options now raise Exceptions
  * some ignorable deprecations have been replaced with error logs
* **pipeline:**  auto-execute all remaining commands at end of `with` block ([814ca2bb](814ca2bb))
* **pool**:  `ConnectionPool.get_connection()` is now a coroutine ([32969ed9](32969ed9))

#### Features

* **auth:**  add support for Redis 5+ user&pass auth ([ca96dc6d](ca96dc6d))
* **client:**  add option to init with client name ([f00c361a](f00c361a))
* **commands:**  add support for SET's KEEPTTL option ([22c62f04](22c62f04))
* **pool:**  implement blocking connection pool ([32969ed9](32969ed9)):
  * this is available as the `BlockingConnectionPool` class; note that it does
    not yet support cluster mode
* **scan:**  add TYPE option ([0625dd8c](0625dd8c))

#### Bug Fixes

* **client:**  prevent retry_on_timeout from affecting ConnectionError ([6626ebce](6626ebce)):
  * ie. `retry_on_timeout` now only comes into play for timeouts
* **cluster:**  avoid runtime error on disconnected client ([740ea19f](740ea19f)):
  * prevents a race condition within `yaaredis` from raising occasional errors
* **connection:**
  *  always reduce count on force disconnect ([b49b3c65](b49b3c65)):
    * fixes some instances of "connection leaking"
  *  expose initial `connect()` error message ([2073f576](2073f576)):
    * by forwarding this message, this should make some debugging a bit easier
* **pubsub:**  reraise CancelledError during _execute ([90dd2641](90dd2641)):
  * prevents an issue where a cancelled coroutine may continue indefinitely

#### Performance

* **cluster:**  support MGET and MSET for hashed keys ([08180835](08180835)):
  * see the following redis documentation for more info:
    https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial#redis-cluster-data-sharding
    you'll need to make use of "hash slots" to get the full benefit of this
    feature

#### Internal

* convert build system to poetry ([b86d695](b86d695)):
  * note that this should not affect end-users, only yaaredis developers
* publish pypi wheels from CI ([05c2265](05c2265)):
  * we should now have wheels for various versions of Python for all releases
  * we currently support manylinux wheels for all compatible Python versions
